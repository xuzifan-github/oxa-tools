# NOTE: before the changes described below are made, a clean deployment will initialize the database with the content found in /edx-platform/lms/djangoapps/bulk_email/fixtures/

# TODO: automate this via oxa-tools deployment
For now, we use these files to update/insert into COURSE_EMAIL_TEMPLATES through the Django LMS admin panel.
This must be done only once when a new platform is created. So that bulk email has the correct template. Instructor's email text message is embedded into this template.

From Django LMS /admin panel

Home -> Bulk_Email -> "Course email templates"

There must be two records in this table.
1) Name			: branded.template
   Html template	: Insert the content of branded.template.html
   Plain template	: Insert the content of branded.template.plain

2) Name                 : 
   Html template        : Insert the content of noname.template.html
   Plain template       : Insert the content of noname.template.plain

# TODO: img src and current year are currently hardcoded, but we should expand the model (and update the markup) to get those at runtime.
# NOTE: the required platform changes for this will happen in
    edx-platform/lms/djangoapps/bulk_email/ and 
    edx-platform/lms/djangoapps/instructor/views/api.py
